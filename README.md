# Overview

InvoiceSystem is an invoice creation and tracking system that takes advantage of SQLite database for Python. 

The prgram allows you to 
- Create: an invoice that contains a job name, billing address, phone number, and charges. 
- Read: your invoices that you have created and track whether or not they have been paid.
- Update: your columns if the job name, billing address, phone number, or pay status has changed. 
- Delete: invoices that are not longer applicable or needed in your database.  

My purpose for creating this program was/is to better understand SQL databases and how to query them through other programs outside of MySQL.

# Relational Database

I am using SQLite. It is already built into python and makes implementing the database simple and easy to use. 

The main table is the 'invoice' table which holds job name, billing address, phone number, and the boolean of whether or not the invoice has been paid. it has an autogenerated primary key.

The secondary table is the 'charges' table which has the columns: charge description and charge amount . Each row has a foreign key tied to the primary key of a row in the 'invoice' table. This allows for an invoice to have multiple charges applied to it. 

# Development Environment

This was written all on VSCode using Python and SQLite (which just needs to imported at the top if Python is already downloaded)

# Future Work

- Ability to timestamp the invoice creation
- Ability to update charges
- Bug fixes, currently dont have any checks if the user puts something in that doesn't fit the database
